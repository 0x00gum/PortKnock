# PortKnock

A demonstration of how a port knocking looks with flags & password authentication.

Port knocking is a common way to open ports externally in a "secure way", the ports are only available for a certain amount of time.

Attackers can copy the flags sent to the server-side so I used an encrypted password to avoid that.
